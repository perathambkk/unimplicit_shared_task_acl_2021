# unimplicit_shared_task_acl_2021
The Transformers for Text Classification Baseline (TTCB) System to a Shared Task on Implicit and Underspecified Language @ACL-2021. <b>We won the competition by sampling more models based on the validation scores.</b> (There were only 2 teams by the way.)

The best result based on XLNet (68.84% dev accuracy) can be viewed as a colab file at https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TQ5vy07WKCbF2T-DY7lEHQVdZtXO43n8?usp=sharing. 

The bertviz visualization of the XLNet model is at https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1W4DqKlrnZN-xAhoUZ9_OAqJIL1i09-y7?usp=sharing.

(After the end of the challenge, we tried MPNet and the result improves a little bit by ~0.2% (69.06% dev accuracy). The colab file for MPNet is at https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NTUChSN2t1a968fWll4ScnokM2ZZOBGT?usp=sharing)
