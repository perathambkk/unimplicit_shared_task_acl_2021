tell them that people in all age groups (including many adults) wearing diapers and many of these individuals have to be assisted with diapering themselves for various reasons .  this is a very delicate matter and every step should be taken to insure that this is done in a supportive manner and in a way that respects the child's dignity .  children over the age of five are especially prone to being sensitive about other people being involved in private matters such as this, so the sister or parent should be cognizant of this fact and act accordingly .  by all means help the child out if they need it (it's essential that the child put on their diapers correctly - a diaper that is poorly fastened will not provide effective protection or will be uncomfortable to wear), but at the same time it's important that the child's emotional well being is protected while helping them with this task . it shouldn't take long for the child to get the hang of this, and they should be encouraged to be independent in this area as soon as possible - it's essential that an older child be able to do this on their own, because if it winds up being an issue that persists throughout their adolescence (or beyond) they're going to want to be able to handle this by themselves in order to avoid embarrassment .  with many people bedwetting is an ongoing issue (which can last even throughout adulthood) and it makes a person feel better about themselves if they are self sufficient in managing this problem, that's why parents should not get in the habit of helping an older child pin on their diapers .  a good analogy might be tying one's shoes .  although it's a bit tricky at first, the child learns to do it on their own after being shown a few times by the adults in their lives .  the same thing can be said with pinning diapers .  here's one last point about older bedwetting children and pinning diapers .  a customer service rep for one company that sells pin-on style cloth diapers for older children, teenagers, and adults said that a child as old as 8 or 9 may need help getting an appropriate fit with pin-on diapers .  as a result the parents may need to pin the diapers on the child .  she mentioned that she has a 9 year old and said that she wasn't sure they'd be able to handle the pinning on their own .  if the parents are in a situation such as this they should handle the diapering the same way they would with an infant - fold the diapers around the child and pin them on .  then put the plastic pants over the diapers .  you can put the pants on the child when they are in lying in bed in which case you have the child lift up their legs then slide the pants over the diapers .  after putting the pants on, turn the child over to make sure the pants are completely covering the diapers in order to prevent the diapers from leaking and getting the bed all wet .  you can also have the child stand up after pinning the diapers on, have them step into the pants, then pull them over the diapers .  again, make sure the pants are completely covering the diapers .  if the parents don't feel that the child will be able to diaper themselves on their own they can resort to this step, however, eventually the child should handle this on their own, unless as mentioned previously the youngster suffers from some cognitive and/or physical disability that prevents or makes it difficult for the child to diaper themselves, after all you don't want a boy or girl who's old enough to go to the prom still having to be diapered by their parents and/or siblings!", "this article offers a number of tips on how to encourage and motivate an older child or teenager who might feel ashamed about wearing diapers  . if the older child or teenager is reluctant to wear diapers, you can read how to encourage older children and teenagers to wear diapers for bedwetting .  this article offers a number of tips on how to encourage and motivate an older child or teenager who might feel ashamed about wearing diapers .  you should also have the child or teenager read it as well .
